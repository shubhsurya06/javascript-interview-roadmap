# 🚀 Ultimate Frontend Interview Roadmap (JavaScript & Angular)

A curated roadmap of **100+ JavaScript** and **60+ Angular** interview questions, categorized from **Basics** to **Advanced Machine Coding**.

This repository is designed to be your one-stop solution for frontend interview preparation. It includes logic puzzles, core theory, asynchronous concepts, architectural deep dives, and practical machine coding tasks.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two major sections, each organized into distinct levels of difficulty and topic depth.

### 💛 JavaScript Section

1.  **Core JavaScript Concepts:** Foundation, data types, scope, closures, and prototypes.
2.  **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Event loop, Promises, Async/Await, and threading.
3.  **JavaScript Coding Challenges:** String manipulation, array logic, and algorithmic thinking.
4.  **Advanced & Modern JavaScript:** DOM, ES6+, memory management, and performance.
5.  **Practical Implementation:** Machine coding rounds (Polyfills, custom utilities, etc.).

### ❤️ Angular Section

1.  **Core Angular Architecture:** Building blocks like Modules, Templates, Metadata, and Lifecycle hooks.
2.  **Components, Routing & Navigation:** Managing views, lazy loading, guards, and component communication.
3.  **Dependency Injection & Services:** Hierarchical injectors, singletons, and resolution modifiers.
4.  **Forms & Validation:** Deep dive into Template-driven vs. Reactive forms and custom validators.
5.  **RxJS & Observables:** Managing streams, operators (`switchMap`, `mergeMap`), and preventing memory leaks.
6.  **HTTP & Interceptors:** Global error handling, modifying headers, and managing requests.
7.  **Modern Angular & Performance:** Signals, Zoneless change detection, Standalone components, and optimization.
8.  **Scenario-Based & System Design:** Real-world problem solving, migrations (e.g., PrimeNG to Material), and security.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

  * **Beginners** looking to solidify their understanding of JS & Angular fundamentals.
  * **Frontend Developers** preparing for technical interviews (Junior to Senior levels).
  * **Interviewers** looking for a structured bank of questions to assess candidates efficiently.
